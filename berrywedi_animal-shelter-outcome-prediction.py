# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

#our next important step is to identify the type of all_animals we have in our dataset

#So from the barchart distribution we can see that the number of dogs are 4500 more than the number of cats. 
# we can also see the sex of the all_animals in our dataset
#to have a better undestanding of our animals groups.
snb.countplot(all_animals.SexuponOutcome, palette='Set1')

#the output shows most of the animals are Neutered Male and very few are Unknown
# Furthermore we can also see the distribution of the age outcome of the all_animals in our dataset 
snb.countplot(all_animals.AgeuponOutcome, palette='Set1')
# so in the above 2 bar charts we observe two important informations that we need to separate for clear visualization
# first we have the information whether the animal is Male or Female
#And second we have whether the animal is neureted, spayed or intact.
#So sepatating these information is helpful for visualization and manupulation
